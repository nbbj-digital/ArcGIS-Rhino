## Description
ArcRhino makes a bridge between Rhino and ArcGIS by allowing you to easily take move information between both the applications.\
It lets you use the the modeling and processing tools available in [Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com/) with the GIS editing enviornment available in [ArcGIS](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview). It does this by using the experimental [RhinoInside](https://www.rhino3d.com/inside) project to create a new window in ArcGIS where you can use all of Rhino's tools and features (along with Grasshopper).\
It converts the basic data types in ArcGIS (points, lines, polylines and polygons) into 3D geometry in Rhino and makes them available as attached metadata in Rhino.\
\
We played with a few experimental projects like:
- Generative Urban Design: Find the "optimal" location for a new park/outdoor theater.
- Site Identification: Selecting Potential Sites for Analysis and Opportunity Weighting.
- Building Use Analysis: For the selected plot, find if the nearby buildings are commercial.
- Solar  Radiation Analysis: For the selected plot, find the best tree locations for optimal comfort.
- Viewshed Analysis: Analysing areas that are visible from specific locations.
- Outdoor Comfort Analysis(UTCI): For the selected plot, find the best tree locations for optimal comfort.\

The projects showcased the strengths of the strong modeling and scripting environment in Rhino along with the specialized GIS management system in ArcGIS to create some iterative design development workflows.
